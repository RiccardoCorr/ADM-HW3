Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

As such, there is an increased need for postgraduate courses to be vocationally orientated, with an emphasis on training students in the theoretical underpinnings and relevant practical areas to work in the sport industry.The PG Diploma/MSc Applied Sport & Exercise Physiology course focuses on disciplines pertinent to the field of applied sport and exercise physiology and reflects the needs of today’s students, within the context of the workforce in general, the social and political environment, and national and regional sporting and exercise priorities.Why St Mary's?The applied focus of the programme enables students to gain both the theoretical and practical skills required to gain employment as a Sport and Exercise Physiologist.In addition, the location of the university provides many opportunities to refine those skills through work with various sports clubs in the area.The course utilises equipment in the School of Sport, Health and Applied Science, which includes extensive laboratory analytical equipment and library materials that support the degree.Course ContentAll modules have a credit value of 20, except for the research project which has a credit value of 60. With the exception of the Advanced Sport and Exercise Physiology module, all modules are assessed by a variety of types of coursework. To qualify for the diploma you need to accrue 120 credits.In addition, MSc students have to complete a substantial research project. Modules are either taught two or three hours per week (Mondays and Wednesdays) or, in the case of the research methods module, in an intensive block.Module Information› Research Methods in Sport and Exercise› Advanced Sport and Exercise Physiology› Training Programme Design and Evaluation› Sport and Exercise Physiology in the Workplace› Ergogenic Aids in Sport› Applied Techniques in Sport and Exercise Physiology› Research ProjectPlease note: All information is correct at the time of publication. However, course content is regularly updated and this may result in some changes, which will be communicated to students before their programme begins.Teaching and AssessmentEach module in the course is assessed by one or more pieces of coursework.
