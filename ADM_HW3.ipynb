Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

This improvement stems from the consideration of additional variables, along with the analysis of the user query to gain insights into the user's search intent. This assumption is grounded in the idea that the user formulates queries with the intention of obtaining the most relevant results from the database, prioritizing them for easier visualization.\n",

Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words represents the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one word into the other. We opted for this measure precisely because, quite often, the input may contain errors such as missing or extra letters or concatenated words. The Levenshtein measure exhibits remarkable robustness in accommodating these variations."

Furthermore, data analytics enables organisations to effectively target specific audiences and to adapt product characteristics based on customer preferences. It can also be used to improve the decision-making process.Yet, despite the immense potential of Big Data, many companies are blind to the value of the data they create. It is time for that to change - and our Data Science programme equips you with the skills to drive this change.   \n",
