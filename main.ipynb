The fast spread of the internet to 63% of global population today and the increased use of digital tools for politics and policy-making bring about new opportunities and challenges. It was hoped that the internet and digital tools would reduce barriers leading to more collective, democratic and borderless collaboration inducing positive social and political change. More recently, the internet is seen to more likely reinforce existing barriers and even as a rising threat to individuals, society, democratic processes and governments. Thus, this master brings together students from different backgrounds to study various political, legal and social problems of today’s digitalisation processes and explore solutions for these new challenges.</td>\n",

       "5995  Digitalisation is a critical issue in today’s global and European politics. The fast spread of the internet to 63% of global population today and the increased use of digital tools for politics and policy-making bring about new opportunities and challenges. It was hoped that the internet and digital tools would reduce barriers leading to more collective, democratic and borderless collaboration inducing positive social and political change. More recently, the internet is seen to more likely reinforce existing barriers and even as a rising threat to individuals, society, democratic processes and governments. Thus, this master brings together students from different backgrounds to study various political, legal and social problems of today’s digitalisation processes and explore solutions for these new challenges.   \n",

Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

This improvement stems from the consideration of additional variables, along with the analysis of the user query to gain insights into the user's search intent.

Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words represents the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one word into the other. We opted for this measure precisely because, quite often, the input may contain errors such as missing or extra letters or concatenated words. The Levenshtein measure exhibits remarkable robustness in accommodating these variations."

    "Leonardo is an intern at a company. He is paid based on the total number of hours he has worked. They agreed d days ago that Leonardo could not work less than `l_i` or more than `r_i` hours per i-th day. Furthermore, he was warned by HR that on his last day at the company, he should provide a detailed report on how many hours he worked each day for the previous `d` days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today is the day Leonardo should report to HR, but the problem is that he didn't account for how many hours he put in for each day, so he only has the total sum of the hours (`total_hours`) he put in total in these `d` days. He believes that if he creates a report in which each number `x_i` corresponds to the total hours he worked on the i-th day while satisfying the HR limitations and the total sum of all `x_i` equals `total_hours`, he would be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "He cannot create such a report independently and requests your assistance. He will give you the number of days `d`, total hours spent `total_hours`, and the HR limitations for each day (`l_i`, `r_i`), and he wants you to assist him in determining whether it is possible to create such a fake report. If that is possible, make such a report.\n",

    "The first line of input contains two integers `d` and `total_hours` - the number of days Leonardo worked there and the total number of hours he worked for the company. Each of the following `d` lines contains two integer numbers `l_i` and `r_i` - the minimum and maximum hours he can work on the i-th day.\n",

    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "If such a report cannot be generated, print 'NO' in one output line. If such a report is possible, print 'YES' in the output and `d` numbers - the number of hours Leonardo spent each day - in the second line. If more than one solution exists, print any of them.\n"
