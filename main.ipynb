This improvement stems from the consideration of additional variables, along with the analysis of the user query to gain insights into the user's search intent. This assumption is grounded in the idea that the user formulates queries with the intention of obtaining the most relevant results from the database, prioritizing them for easier visualization.\n",

    "Moreover, the utilization of Levenshtein distance as a string metric proves to be highly beneficial for quantifying the dissimilarity between two sequences, especially when they exhibit similarities. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words represents the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one word into the other. We opted for this measure precisely because, quite often, the input may contain errors such as missing or extra letters or concatenated words. The Levenshtein measure exhibits remarkable robustness in accommodating these variations."

    "Using maps can help people understand how far one university is from another so they can plan their academic careers more adequately. Here, we challenge you to show a map of the courses found with the score defined in point 3. You should be able to identify at least the city and country for each MSc degree. You can find some ideas on how to create maps in Python [here](https://plotly.com/python/maps/) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python-e070374fe621) but you will maybe need further information for a proper visualization, like coordinates (latitude and longitude). You can retrieve this data using various tools:\n",

    "2. You can collect a list of unique places in the format (City, Country) and ask chatGPT (or, as usual, any other LLM chatbot) to provide you with a list of corresponding representative coordinates\n",
    "3. Explore and find the best solution for your case!\n",
    "Once you defined your visualization strategy, include a way to encode fees in your charts. The map should show (with a proper legend) different courses and associated taxation: the user wants a glimpse not only of how far he will need to move but also of how much it will cost him!\n",

He believes that if he creates a report in which each number `x_i` corresponds to the total hours he worked on the i-th day while satisfying the HR limitations and the total sum of all `x_i` equals `total_hours`, he would be fine.\n",
